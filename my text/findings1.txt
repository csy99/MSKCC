findings:
1. fixed: there may be a bug with implementation, the last line of the input data is not converted
2. in mode 0: each line will be converted into two examples: relation with two directions
	each entity in the training example will be represented as both self-entity and self-label in prediction, 
	no matter if this entity appear as an entity/label in the training example. 
	In addition, the embeddings for self-entity and self-label are very different different. 
3. in mode 4: relation with two labels
	the embeddings for directions and its reverse one is more similar (or we do not even need to create a reverse one)
4. when embedding size is smaller, the training error is larger


questions:
1. how do they exactly do the embeddings? (StarSpace and ur code)
2. test mode verbose not doing a great job
3. mode 4
4. toy data for your code
5. each entity may be represented by different entities in ur code.
